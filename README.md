# Settlement-Prediction
Welcome to the Embankment Settlement Prediction Project!

This repository contains the code and data for predicting settlement in embankments constructed on soft soil using various machine learning algorithms. The project aims to enhance settlement prediction accuracy, enabling better geotechnical engineering design and construction practices.

**Project Structure:**
- The Jupyter Notebook files where comprehensive data analysis and interpretation have been performed. It includes the exploration of various input variables and their impact on settlement behavior.
- The  two CSV files containing 13 input variables and one output variable, representing the settlement values after 30 days and 1 year, respectively. These values were calculated using GeoStudio software and serve as the training and testing datasets for our predictive models.
- The necessary files for developing a user-friendly web application. Users can input specific embankment characteristics, and the application will predict the settlement using the best-performing machine learning algorithm from the analysis.

**Machine Learning Algorithms:**
We have employed linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network algorithms to predict settlement behavior. The goal was to determine which algorithm offers the most accurate and reliable results for settlement prediction in different scenarios.

**Contributions:**
Feel free to explore and contribute to this project. We encourage you to share your insights, suggestions, and ideas for further improvement and optimization. Your collaboration will help us enhance the accuracy and usability of our predictive models.

We hope this project proves to be valuable for the geotechnical engineering community, providing a practical and efficient approach to settlement prediction in embankments constructed on soft soil.

Let's build a more resilient and safe infrastructure together!
